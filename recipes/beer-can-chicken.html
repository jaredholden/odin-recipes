    <p>This beer can-chicken recipe produces deliciously moist chicken. It's perfect for a BBQ on a hot summer day. The other half of the can of beer is for the cook to enjoy while preparing dinner!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 (12 fluid ounce) can of beer</li>
        <li>1 (3 pund) whole chicken</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, about 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, dry mustard, salt, and black pepper in a small bowl. Place half-full can of beer in the center of a plate.</li>
        <li>Rinse chicken under cold running water. Discard giblets and neck from chicken; drain and pat dry. Fit whole chicken over the can of beer with the legs on the bottom; keep upright. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of seasoning mix into the top cavity of chicken. Beer may foam up when seasonings fall inside the can. Rub remaining seasoning mix over entire surface of chicken.</li>
        <li>Place chicken, standing on the can, directly on the preheated grill. Close the lid and cook chicken until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the grill and discard beer can. Cover chicken with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
