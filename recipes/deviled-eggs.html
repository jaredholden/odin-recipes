    <h1>Chef John's Deviled Eggs</h1>
    <img src="../images/deviled-eggs.webp">

    <p>My deviled eggs recipe is fairly standard, except I like to add a little cream cheese. Unlike mayonnaise, cream cheese firms up when chilled, and provides a little more luxurious texture.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablesoons water</li>
        <li>1 red jalapeno pepper, sliced into thin rings</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/3 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Sriracha or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon rice attack</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped chives</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place eggs in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Remove from heat, cover the pot, and let sit for 17 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the warm sugar syrup over the pepper rings in a small bowl. Stir and set aside.</li>
        <li>Drain eggs and fill the pan with very cold water. Let eggs sit in cold water until they are cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel eggs and slice in half lengthwise. Remove yolks to a bowl and cover the egg white halves with a damp towel while you prepare the filling.</li>
        <li>Mash together egg yolks, cream cheese, mayonnaise, Sriracha sauce, and Dijon mustard with a spoon or spatula until just combined. Stir in rice vinegar until smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Pipe filling into the egg white halves.</li>
        <li>Top each egg with a ring of candied pepper and chopped chives. Chill for at least 20 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
